                    it is possible to increase its testability`,
                `The cases developed by test designers should be analyzed
                    with regard to the TAS ability to implement them`,
                `The changes in the TAS, supporting new features, 
                should not break existing TAS functionality`,
                `Traceability from the requirements to the test
                cases will indicate which test cases need to be updated 
                to support new feature testing`
